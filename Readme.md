# Automatic Fish Feeder


This repository contains the code of an automatic fish feeder you can build yourself. It is based on the AI-Thinker ESP32-cam (though for now camera is not being used). The 3D printable body is available on cults3d for free. It is intended to be used with fish food flakes, (I did not try it with pellets)

**Required hardware**

* 1 sg90 micro servo
* 4 15mm long M3 screws
* 1 AI_Thinker ESP32-cam MB (so the esp32-cam **and** the programmer)
* Fish food flakes
